### Project Overview

This project highlights major racial disparities in maternal mortality rates in the United States from 2019-2023. Consistent with existing literature, it was found that Native Americans and Black Americans have drastically higher maternal mortality rates compared to other races and ethnicities.

### Data Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is the "VSRR Provisional Maternal Death Counts and Rates" csv file from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This dataset was last updated in January 2024, and provides provisional maternal mortality rates in the United States from 2019-2023 based on mortality and natality data from the National Vital Statistics System.

### Recommendations


### Limitations

After removing missing values, there was limited data for Native Americans. Specifically, there was not any data recorded from 2019,2020, and 2023 compared to other races/ethnicities. This potentially could impact accuracy of drastic differences.
